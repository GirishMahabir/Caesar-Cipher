### Description:

A Caesar Cipher program written in C Language that can encode, decode and calculate the frequency of characters present.

Originally it was an assignment that I got and I had never coded in C before.
It was an awesome experience of learning and building this program.

### What can it do:

- Encrypt
- Decrypt
- Frequency Analysis
- Print a short description of Caesar Ciphers.

### Compiling:

We will be using gcc which will be present in most of the linux distributions to compile our code.

After the -o in the command you can name the output binary however you want.

```bash
gcc main.c -o caesarcipher 
```

### Running the binary:

```bash
./caesarcipher
```
